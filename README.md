Houston Marathon Data

Place to keep and track Houston Marathon Data for some TBD projects.

Ideas -
* Scrape data from legacy and vet athletes to look at splits over the years
* Identify if frequent HouRunners are better at running even races?
* What characteristics are good in developing strategy to run Houston?
